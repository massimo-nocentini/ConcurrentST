# ConcurrentST

This repo hosts an implementation of the concurrent language [CML](http://cml.cs.uchicago.edu/), 
designed by [John H. Reppy](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr/), and it is
- described in more depth in a [book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/concurrent-programming-in-ml/2144B15062AD1042FC04B1D0DE5DFFAC);
- subject of many [publications](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr/papers/cml.html) by the original designer;
- included in the [SML/NJ](https://www.smlnj.org/) distribution and
- available as standalone [tarball](http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu/dist/working/110.97/cml.tgz).

We port it to [Pharo Smalltalk](https://pharo.org/) for personal edification and, of course, fun.
